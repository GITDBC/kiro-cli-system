# TODO lists

> Automatic TODO list creation and management for multi-step tasks

The TODO list feature enables Kiro to automatically create and modify task lists, while providing you with commands to view and manage existing TODO lists.

## Getting started

TODO lists are automatically created when Kiro breaks down complex tasks. You can then manage these lists using the `/todo` command.

### Enable TODO lists

```bash
kiro-cli settings chat.enableTodoList true
```

### Basic usage

```bash
/todo view      # View existing TODO lists
/todo resume    # Resume a TODO list
```

## How it works

### Automatic creation

Kiro automatically creates TODO lists when:
- You ask for help with multi-step tasks
- A complex problem needs to be broken down
- You explicitly request a TODO list

**Example:**
```
> Make a todo list with 3 read-only tasks.

I'll create a todo list with 3 read-only tasks for you.

🛠️  Using tool: todo_list (trusted)
 ⋮ 
 ● TODO:
[ ] Review project documentation
[ ] Check system status
[ ] Read latest updates
 ⋮ 
 ● Completed in 0.4s
```

### Task management

Kiro can:
- Create TODO lists
- Mark tasks as complete
- Add/remove tasks
- Load TODO lists by ID
- Search for existing TODO lists

You can:
- View TODO lists
- Resume TODO lists
- Delete TODO lists

## Commands

### /todo view

Display and select a TODO list to view its contents, showing task descriptions and completion status.

```bash
/todo view
```

**Interactive selection shows:**
- ✓ Completed lists (green checkmark)
- ✗ In-progress lists with completion count (red X with progress)

**Example:**
```
> /todo view

? Select a to-do list to view: ›
❯ ✗ Unfinished todo list (0/3)
  ✔ Completed todo list (3/3)
```

### /todo resume

Show an interactive menu of available TODO lists with their current progress status. Selecting a list loads it back into your chat session, allowing Kiro to continue where it left off.

```bash
/todo resume
```

**Example:**
```
> /todo resume

⟳ Resuming: Read-only tasks for information gathering

🛠️  Using tool: todo (trusted)
 ⋮ 
 ● TODO:
[x] Review project documentation
[ ] Check system status
[ ] Read latest updates
 ⋮ 
 ● Completed in 0.1s
```

### /todo clear-finished

Remove all completed TODO lists from storage. This helps clean up your workspace by removing lists where all tasks have been completed.

```bash
/todo clear-finished
```

### /todo delete

Delete specific TODO lists or all lists at once.

```bash
/todo delete           # Interactive selection to delete one list
/todo delete --all     # Delete all TODO lists
```

**Options:**
- `--all` - Delete all TODO lists without interactive selection

## Storage

TODO lists are persisted across sessions

Each list is saved as a JSON file with:
- Unique timestamp-based ID
- Task descriptions and completion status
- Context updates from completed tasks
- Modified file paths
- Overall list description

### Directory structure

```
my-project/
├── .kiro/
│   └── cli-todo-lists/
│       ├── 1234567890-task-list.json
│       └── 1234567891-another-list.json
└── src/
    └── main.py
```

## Interactive selection

All commands use interactive selection allowing you to:
- Navigate with arrow keys
- Press Enter to select
- Press Esc to cancel

## Use cases

### Breaking down complex tasks

```
> I need to migrate our database from MySQL to PostgreSQL

Let me create a TODO list for this migration:

🛠️  Using tool: todo
 ● TODO: Database Migration
[ ] Backup current MySQL database
[ ] Set up PostgreSQL instance
[ ] Create schema migration scripts
[ ] Test migration on staging
[ ] Perform production migration
[ ] Verify data integrity
```

### Tracking multi-step implementations

```
> Help me implement user authentication

I'll break this down into manageable steps:

🛠️  Using tool: todo
 ● TODO: User Authentication Implementation
[ ] Set up authentication library
[ ] Create user model and database schema
[ ] Implement registration endpoint
[ ] Implement login endpoint
[ ] Add password hashing
[ ] Create JWT token generation
[ ] Add authentication middleware
[ ] Write tests for auth flow
```

### Resuming previous work

```
> /todo resume

? Select a to-do list to resume: ›
❯ ✗ User Authentication Implementation (3/8)
  ✗ Database Migration (1/6)
  ✔ Code Refactoring (5/5)

# Select "User Authentication Implementation"

⟳ Resuming: User Authentication Implementation

Let's continue with the authentication implementation. 
We've completed the first 3 tasks. Next up is implementing the login endpoint...
```

## Best practices

### Managing lists

- **Use `clear-finished` regularly** to remove completed lists
- **Resume lists** to continue complex multi-step tasks
- **Check `view`** to see progress without resuming

### Workflow integration

- **Let Kiro create TODO lists** for complex tasks automatically
- **Use `resume`** to pick up where you left off in previous sessions
- **Check `view`** to see what tasks remain before resuming work

### Organization

- **Work in project directories** where TODO lists are relevant
- **Complete tasks in order** for better context
- **Delete old lists** when no longer needed

## Limitations

### Functionality

- Cannot manually edit TODO list files
- Cannot merge or split TODO lists
- Cannot reorder tasks after creation

## Troubleshooting

### Tasks not updating

If task completion isn't being tracked:

1. **Ensure TODO list is active**: Resume the list first
2. **Let Kiro mark tasks**: Don't manually edit JSON files
3. **Check for errors**: Look for error messages in chat

## Tool vs command

### `todo` tool

The `todo` tool is for Kiro to call. Kiro can:
- Create TODO lists
- Mark tasks as complete
- Add/remove tasks
- Load TODO lists with given ID
- Search for existing TODO lists

### `/todo` command

The `/todo` command is for you to manage existing TODO lists. You can:
- View TODO lists
- Resume TODO lists
- Delete TODO lists
- Clear finished lists

## Example workflow

### 1. Start complex task

```
> I need to set up CI/CD for our project
```

### 2. Kiro creates TODO list

```
🛠️  Using tool: todo_list
 ● TODO: CI/CD Setup
[ ] Choose CI/CD platform
[ ] Create pipeline configuration
[ ] Set up build stage
[ ] Add test stage
[ ] Configure deployment stage
[ ] Set up environment variables
[ ] Test pipeline
```

### 3. Work through tasks

Kiro works through tasks, marking them complete as you go.

### 4. Resume later

```
> /todo resume

? Select a to-do list to resume: ›
❯ ✗ CI/CD Setup (4/7)

# Continue where you left off
```

### 5. Clean up when done

```
> /todo clear-finished
```
